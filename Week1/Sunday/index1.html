        <p>I am an <strong>information systems engineer</strong> and a graduate of ORT Braude College.
During my academic studies, I was part of the college swimming team.
These experiences combined technical growth with sports discipline.</p>

            I work as a training coordinator for the <em>Magshimim</em> excellence program.
The program aims to guide teens from Israelâ€™s geographic and social periphery toward elite military tech units.
It focuses on reducing social gaps through technological education.

            I recently moved to Tel Aviv after living in Haifa for several years.
I got married last month, and my wife, who grew up in Tel Aviv, was excited to return.
We are settling into our new home and enjoying this fresh start.
