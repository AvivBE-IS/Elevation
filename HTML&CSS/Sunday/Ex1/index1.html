      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr class="head-line" />
      <p>
        My name is <span class="purple-class">Aviv Ben Ezra</span>. I am an
        <span class="purple-class">information systems engineer</span> and a
        graduate of <span class="green-class">ORT Braude College</span>. During
        my academic studies, I was part of the
        <span class="green-class">college swimming team</span>. These
        experiences combined technical growth with sports discipline.

      <h2>My Job</h2>
      <hr class="head-line" />
      <p>
        I work as a <span class="purple-class">training coordinator</span> for
        the <em>Magshimim</em> excellence program. The program aims to guide
        teens from Israelâ€™s geographic and social periphery toward
        <span class="green-class">elite military tech units</span>. It focuses
        on reducing social gaps through technological education.

      <hr class="head-line" />
      <p>
        I recently moved to <span class="purple-class">Tel Aviv</span> after
        living in <span class="green-class">Haifa</span> for several years. I
        got married last month, and my wife, who grew up in Tel Aviv, was
        excited to return. We are settling into our new home and enjoying this
        fresh start.
